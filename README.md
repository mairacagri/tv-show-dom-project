# TV Show DOM Project
This is the minimal exercise I did in the very early phase of learning web development. The app uses DOM to render data from script.js into the page. It uses html, CSS and javascript. The app lists multiple TV shows with their episodes. There is a searchbar where user can search an episode by typing some key words eg 'gold'. It is case insesitive. There is also a dropdown to select a show which, then, renders all the episodes of that particular show
